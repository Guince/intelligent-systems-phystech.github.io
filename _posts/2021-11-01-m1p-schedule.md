The expected result of the course is a research paper, submitted to a peer-reviewed journal from the list of the Higher Attestation Commission.

## Goals

* General: to learn how to convey the author's message to the reader in a clear way.
* Practical: to publish a scientific paper, to be welcome in the research society.

## Delivery

* Research paper in a peer-reviewed scientific journal
* Computational experiment with analysis and code to reproduce it
* Slides with a brief comprehensive results
* Video of the presentation speech

## Consultations

* The workflow goes around each week, namely, week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
* The iterative consultations and delivery of results are highly welcome! Start during the weekends.
* Deadline of the last version is: Wednesday 6:00am. The review goes on Wednesday working day.
* Each symbol A gives +1 according the system (А-, А, А+). No symbol gives A0.

## Workload

* Student's workload depends on the group and can vary from 54 hours and up.
* A consultant is expected to make one-hour meeting weekly and promptly to student's questions. So it makes 12 to 16 hours.
* An expert is expected to state the problem and evaluate the delivery. It takes one hour maximum. And we guess any researcher is ready to discuss the favourite problem. In fact, it makes the negative workload: for a problem the expert solves as a daily routine some delivery appears after several months of synchronized work. The quality of the stated problem matters.
