### About Us

The base department graduates bachelors and masters in the direction 09/01/00 "Applied Mathematics and Physics". Training is conducted in the specializations Data Mining, Design and Organization of Systems. The base organization is the Computing Center of the Federal Research Center “Informatics and Management” of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Specialization - "Data Mining" was created, the head of which was the corresponding member. RAS K.V. Rudakov, founded in 2003 at one of the oldest basic departments of the FUPM MIPT "Management and Computing Systems" (Computing Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences).
The specialization "Design and organization of systems" was created in the 1970s by the founder of the Russian school of artificial intelligence methods, academician G. S. Pospelov as a base department with the same name at the Computing Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The main directions of educational and scientific activities of the department:
Machine learning, multivariate statistics, model selection and neural network architectures, model ensembles and generative neural networks, functional data analysis and spatio-temporal data analysis.
Applied research areas: text analysis and thematic modeling, image and video analysis, signal and human behavior analysis, brain-computer interfaces.

Every year the department accepts and graduates 10-15 undergraduate and graduate students. At the same time, up to 50 students from the third to the sixth year study at the department. All graduates (more than 300 people) successfully work in the field of machine learning and building artificial intelligence systems. Half of the graduates defended their dissertations of the candidate of physical and mathematical or technical sciences.

### Main courses:
Machine learning, read by K.V. Vorontsov is the most famous and complete course in Russia, covering fundamental and modern topics of machine learning and data analysis. The course is also taught at the Curser, at the School of Data Analysis, at Moscow State University.

My first scientific article (automation of scientific research), read by V.V. Strizhov is a course that provides the basics for performing scientific research - from planning to presenting results. Each student chooses a personal project and receives a personal consultant and expert. For three months, the student prepares a scientific article with theory and computational experiment. The results are presented at scientific conferences, articles are submitted to peer-reviewed journals. The course has been running since 2011. More than 600 ?? Projects. Results of recent years [here]

### Principles of Scientific Work
Openness of ideas, projects, results at all stages of study and research
Continuous assessment of the quality of ideas and results
Communication with the scientific community, updating according to the latest achievements.
